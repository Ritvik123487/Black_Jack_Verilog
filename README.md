# Black_Jack_Verilog

Project created in verilog to mimic a casiino blacjack game - player vs CPU.

VGA device and FPGA required for user interface and graphics

Notes:
- All Verilog modules are contained in fill.v
- MIF files are required to display the cards to VGA
- Will need to use quartus prime to run the code (MacOS currently does not support this)
